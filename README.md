# Zomato
This project analyzes Zomato restaurant data to uncover trends in ratings, online orders, restaurant types,  ratings, pricing, and customer preferences through data cleaning and visualization.

## Pre-Processing
**•	Handled Missing Ratings:**

**•	Cleaned Up Costs:**

**•	Removed Unnecessary Columns:**
Got rid of columns that weren't useful for our analysis and kept important information like restaurant names, ratings, prices, locations, and cuisine types

**•	Fixed Missing Data:**
Filled in missing values where possible (like using the most common location when location was missing)
Removed any remaining rows with missing critical information


## Analysis
•	Most restaurants say "Yes" to online orders. It's like seeing that more shops deliver food home now. This helps understand if online food is       popular in Bangalore.

•	Fewer restaurants allow bookings. Maybe most are quick-eat places, not fancy dinners. Tells us Bangalore has more casual spots.

•	Restaurants with online orders have slightly higher ratings (people like convenience?). It's like saying "Delivery places get better stars         because they're easy to use."

•	Places where you can book tables have higher ratings. Maybe these are nicer restaurants where people plan visits and give good reviews.

•	"Delivery" type has the most "Yes" for online orders (makes sense!). "Buffet" has fewer. It shows which restaurant styles love online business.    Like, cafes might prefer you coming in, but delivery spots focus on sending food.


**This analysis helps to better understand:**

•	Popular Dining Trends: What kinds of restaurants people prefer (like buffets)

•	Price Ranges: How much you might expect to pay when dining out

•	Quality Indicators: How ratings are distributed and what constitutes a good rating

•	The cleaned data and visualizations provide valuable insights for both restaurant owners (to understand competition) and food enthusiasts (to      make better dining choices).
